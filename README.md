# üìë Leafleth

Leafleth is a documentation generator for your Solidity smart-contracts. It also integrates a template engine to allow anyone to create customized documentation in a snap.

## üéâ Example

[This example](https://github.com/clemlak/leafleth/blob/master/examples/BasicExample.md) was generated using the default template provided by Leafleth.

## üì¶ Installation

You can install Leafleth as a global package:

Using npm:

`npm i -g leafleth@alpha`

Or using yarn:

`yarn add global leafleth@alpha`

Additionally, Leafleth can be installed as a local package in your project.

## üöÄ Usage

First of all, be sure to comment your smart-contracts according to the [NatSpec format](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/natspec-format.html). Once you're done, compile your contracts and let Leafleth handle the rest!

Use the following command to generate your documentation:

`leafleth -s <source>`

The source is the only required option, and it must refer to the path of a `.json` file (a compiled contract) or to an entire directory (for example, the `build/contracts` directory if you are using Truffle).

### üéõ Options

* `-s` or `--source` **(required)**: The path to a file or a directory, which will be used to generate the documentation.
* `-o` or `--output`: The directory used to output the documentation. If no value is provided, Leafleth will output the documentation into the source directory.
* `-t` or `--template`: The template used to generate the documentation. If no value is provided, the default template will be used.
* `-d` or `--debug`: Enable debug mode.
* `-V` or `--version`: Display the version number.
* `-h` or `--help`: Display usage information.

## üé® Create your own themes

Internally, Leafleth uses [Squirrelly](https://squirrelly.js.org/) for its template engine. This means that any type of documentation (Markdown, HTML, ...) can be generated if you provide the right template.

To create a new template, you can use the [default](https://github.com/clemlak/leafleth/blob/master/templates/default.sqrl) one as a base or start a new `.sqrl` file from scratch. The content of the templates is totally free, and the only requirement is that they must be a valid [Squirrelly](https://squirrelly.js.org/) template.

While generating the documentation, Leafleth will send the following object to your template:

```json
{
  "contract": {
    "name": "BasicExample",
    "notice": "A notice for the basic contract",
    "title": "A basic contract",

        },
        {
          "internalType": "uint256",
          "name": "",
          "type": "uint256"
        }
      ],
      "notice": "Gets two numbers",
      "details": "This function looks complex",
      "return": "A cool numberAnother cool number"
    },
    "add": {
      "constant": true,
      "payable": false,
      "stateMutability": "pure",
      "type": "function",
      "outputs": [
        {
          "internalType": "uint256",
          "name": "",
          "type": "uint256"
        }
      ],
      "notice": "Add two numbers",
      "details": "This function looks complex",
      "return": "The sum of a + b",
      "params": {
        "b": {
          "description": "Another number",
          "type": "uint256"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To display a value, you'll simply have to use its [global reference](https://squirrelly.js.org/docs/v7/global-refs/). For example:

```html
<h1>{{contract.title}}</h1>
```

Methods or other objects can be listed using [loops](https://squirrelly.js.org/docs/v7/cheatsheet#looping-over-objects).

When you're ready, simply run the following command to generate your documentation using your own template:

`leafleth -s <source> -t <yourTemplate>`
